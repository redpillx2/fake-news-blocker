# Fake News Block File

## Purpose

If you're tired of seeing absolutely fake news and trying to guess whether or not these sources can lie to you or not this is your solution. Got kids and don't want their brains full of lies? That's what this is for.

Basically, the criteria here is only outlets that post verifiably false stories. This is why Huffington Post might be on this list, but Fox News may not, etc. It's not about who's option you don't like or even that I don't like.

## Usage

In pihole you simply log onto the admin interface and copy/ paste the direct URL to blockfile.txt into the block lists and click, "Add", there is nothing more to do.

Other software like Adblock Plus or compatible programs might allow you to install custom lists as well and you will have to do the same in these programs in their configuration.

## Additions To The List

Submit them in the appropriate section of this site and they will be reviewed and possibly added to the list. Try to link to proof. I have no intent to frequently update the list, and it's mostly to get rid of the most aggregious offenders. However, periodically, I will.
